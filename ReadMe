There are 3 screens in our game: Welcome Screen, Initial Configuration Screen, Initial Game Screen
 1). Welcome screen:
    testStart() in WelcomeTest.java tests whether the next scene is correctly
    loaded when the Start button is pressed.
 2). Initial Config screen:
    testWeapon() in InitialConfigTest.java tests whether the weapon label
    displays the weapon selected. When weapon button 1 is clicked, the label
    should be changed to "Weapon:  Stick".
 3). Initial Game screen: It contains 4 rooms and 1 button.
    The test shows "current money", "current difficulty" and "current level" of
    the player, and the player with higher difficulty is provided with higher
    intial money. The difficulty level in "Initial Game screen" is consistent
    with the difficulty level chosen in the "Initial Config screen". When click
    on the "BACK" button, it takes you back to the "Initial Config screen" and
    you can reset your configuration.
